# What is Diskcoin?

Diskcoin is a scalable peer-to-peer crypto currency system that is more energy efficient than Bitcoin, while retaining most of the features of Bitcoin, such as peer-to-peer networks, minimal network architecture, and security. Diskcoin uses the Conditioned Proof Of Capacity ( CPoC ) consensus algorithm to reduce the consumption of electricity and lower the entry barriers in the process of crypto currency production, which is more decentralized, without affecting security. In addition, Diskcoin adopts an algorithm named the Dynamic Equilibrium Staking ( DES ) to adjust the staking percentage according to the difficulty of mining, instead of a simply fixed or decrease progressively staking proportion. Diskcoin is an great innovation in the evolution of the CPoC consensus algorithm.
